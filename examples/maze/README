The Maze Game: A RubyObjC toy

-- 

This directory contains a toy application that generates mazes
to be navigated by one or two users.  Use the keyboard to navigate
the maze until the circles meet.

Use the arrow keys to move the circle on the right and 
'w','a','s', and 'd' to move the right circle.

To build this, simply type "rake" from the terminal.  You can then run the application
in the usual way or by simply typing "rake run".
