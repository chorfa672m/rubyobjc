RubyRocks Revisited

-- 

This directory contains a revised version of the RubyRocks program 
originally published on RubyCocoa Resources (http://www.rubycocoa.com).

Besides having many new features, it has also been ported to RubyObjC,
a new Ruby/Objective-C bridge.

To build it, simply type "rake" from the terminal.  You can then run the application
in the usual way or by simply typing "rake run".
