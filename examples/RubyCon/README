RubyCon: Ruby Plug In Example

-- 
Adds a Ruby console to any Cocoa application.  Requires a local installation of Ruby (for IRB).
Specify the applications you want to enhance in the array in the RubyCon.m source file.

WARNING: This does not work well with RubyObjC applications, which already contain an embedded interpreter and console.
It has not been tested with RubyCocoa, but it will probably cause any application with an embedded Ruby interpreter to crash.
