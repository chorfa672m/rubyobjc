RubyObjC RaiseMan

-- 

This directory contains a RubyObjC implementation of the RaiseMan example 
described in Aaron Hillegass' "Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X, Second Edition".

It was adapted from a RubyCocoa port begun by Nicholas Chen and posted
at http://blog.vazexqi.com.

It illustrates many important Cocoa concepts including the Cocoa document
architecture, saving and restoring documents with files, preferences and 
user defaults, bindings, and notifications.

To build it, simply type "rake" from the terminal.  You can then run the application
in the usual way or by simply typing "rake run".
