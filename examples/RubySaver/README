Ruby Screen Saver

-- 

Too late for IronCoder V, this directory contains a screen saver written in Ruby with RubyObjC.
Derived from the Maze game example, it creates, draws, and solves mazes.

To build it, simply type "rake" from the terminal.  
Then use "rake install" to install the screen saver.
