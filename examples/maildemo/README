MailDemo in Ruby

-- 

This directory contains a RubyObjC version of Scott Stevenson's 
MailDemo tutorial.  You can find Scott's tutorial online at
	http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000080.php

This version does nearly everything in Ruby.  The interface is
still built in IB, but instead of hooking up the controllers 
in IB, we expose the interface elements and then hook everything
up in Ruby.  I think that makes the bindings a lot more clear,
because everything can then be described in just a few lines of
Ruby that I can easily scan through and verify at once.  You 
can judge for yourself.

This example requires RubyObjC.  For installation instructions, 
see http://www.rubyobjc.com.

To build it, simply type "rake" from the terminal.  You can then 
run the application in the usual way or by simply typing "rake run".
